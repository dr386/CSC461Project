# Survey on the Wireless TV Technology
## Introduction:
   Television technology has seen a significant evolution over the years. The latest frontier is the development of wireless TVs, which promise to enhance user experience by eliminating the clutter of cables and offering greater flexibility in TV placement. This research project aims to survey the underlying principles behind this emerging technology.
## Problem Statement:
While the concept of wireless TVs is gaining traction, a comprehensive understanding of the foundational principles behind this technology is crucial for future innovations and improvements. This research seeks to delve deep into these principles to provide clarity and insight.
## Literature Review
Traditional televisions have been bound by cables, from HDMI to power connectors. Recent models, such as LG's M3, hint at a transition towards semi-wireless solutions, yet they still require a power connection. Current literature suggests that the principles of wireless power and data transmission are well-established, but their integration and application in the context of large-scale devices like TVs present unique challenges and considerations.
## Proposed Approach:
Literature review of existing academic papers, patents, and industry publications. Analysis of current wireless TV models to understand their implementation of these principles.
## Conclusion:
Understanding the principles behind wireless TV technology is pivotal for its future evolution and refinement. This research aims to provide a comprehensive survey of these principles, offering valuable insights for academics, industry professionals, and innovators.
