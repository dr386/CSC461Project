# Biweekly Update Nov 20  

## Let's talk about IEEE 802.11ad
802.11ad is a wireless networking standard that enables very high throughput and data rates up to multiple gigabits per second by using the 60 GHz frequency band. It is also known as WiGig, and it is part of the IEEE 802.11 family of standards. However, it has some limitations, such as short range, difficulty in passing through obstacles, and interference from other devices operating in the same band.

### Millimeter Wave Frequency
The 60 GHz band falls within the millimeter-wave spectrum. Millimeter waves are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths considerably shorter than those used in typical Wi-Fi networks, which allows for high data rate transmission.

### High Data Rates
Due to the wide bandwidth available in the 60 GHz band, it can support very high data rates, up to several gigabits per second. This makes it ideal for applications requiring rapid data transfer, such as high-definition video streaming.

### Short Range and Line-of-Sight Operation
The 60 GHz frequency has a limited range, typically effective within a single room. The high frequency signals have poor penetration through walls and are absorbed by oxygen in the air, leading to a rapid decrease in signal strength over distance.

### Beamforming
To address the range and penetration limitations, 60 GHz technology employs advanced beamforming techniques. Beamforming allows the device to focus the Wi-Fi signal in a specific direction towards the intended device, rather than broadcasting in all directions, enhancing signal strength and reducing interference.

### Channel Bonding
This technology can bond multiple 60 GHz channels together, further increasing the data rate. Channel bonding allows for more efficient use of the available spectrum.

### Low Latency
The high data rates and efficient transmission methods result in very low latency, beneficial for applications like virtual reality or gaming, where real-time interaction is crucial.

### Interference and Regulation
The 60 GHz band is typically less crowded than the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, leading to less interference. However, regulatory constraints for the 60 GHz band can vary significantly between different regions.

### Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS)
Some 60 GHz systems may include DFS to avoid interference with other systems and to comply with regulatory requirements.

### Security and Privacy
Since the signal doesn't penetrate well through walls, it's naturally more contained, offering a degree of security and privacy. However, standard Wi-Fi security protocols are still necessary.

### Applications 
Beyond Wi-Fi, 60 GHz technology is also explored for other applications like wireless personal area networks (WPANs), point-to-point outdoor links, and potentially in 5G networks as part of small-cell deployments.

### Hardware Requirements
Devices must have specific hardware designed to operate in the 60 GHz band. This includes antennas and RF circuits capable of handling the high frequency and advanced signal processing capabilities for beamforming.
