# Midterm Update

## Introduction
- LG introduced a 97-inch model called the LG SIGNATURE OLED M, which is hailed as the world's first consumer TV with Zero Connect technology.
- The Zero Connect technology is a wireless solution that allows the transmission of 4K video and audio without the need for cables.
- The TV has a built-in receiver in the screen, while the Zero Connect Box contains all the necessary inputs and outputs.
- This wireless TV can deliver 4K video at 120Hz and supports multiple audio formats, including Dolby Atmos​1​.

## What is OLED?
OLED, or Organic Light Emitting Diodes, is a display technology that offers several advantages over traditional LCD and LED displays. OLED technology is indeed widely used in modern displays, including televisions, smartphones, and smartwatches, due to its ability to produce deep blacks and high contrast ratios. 
Here are some products using the OLED:
- LG OLED TVs: LG is one of the leading manufacturers of OLED TVs. They offer a range of models, including the C1, CX, and the more recent G1 series, which feature their proprietary OLED evo technology that claims to have better brightness and colors.
- Apple iPhone 12 and newer models: Starting with the iPhone X, Apple has been using OLED screens in their smartphones. The iPhone 12 series and beyond feature Super Retina XDR OLED displays.
This technology is not new, therefore researching it falls out of the scope.

## What's the techs behind the Zero Connect Box?
LG creates a Zero Connect Box which is used as a relay of LG's wireless OLED TV system. Here's a summary of the latest research underpinning the technology behind the new device:
- The Zero Connect Box uses proprietary LG technology to transmit large amounts of data at speeds up to three times faster than the Wi-Fi 6E standard. This enables the transmission of video signals along with Dolby Atmos sound and HDR (including Dolby Vision) wirelessly and losslessly up to 4K/120Hz.
- The system is designed to work around objects that might obstruct its signals and has a range of up to 10 meters between the Zero Connect and the screen.
- The TV uses an algorithm that determines the optimal transmission path, reducing errors or interruptions.
- The Zero Connect Box's antenna can be repositioned to strengthen the signal and supports voice recognition for controlling the TV and connected devices.

## Technical Challenges
The technique details behind the wireless transmission are still not uncovered.
